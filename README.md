# Central Limit Theorem Demonstration

This application illustrates the Central Limit Theorem, specifically how it
tends to a Gaussian distribution when multiple probability distributions are
added. As such, distributions that are far away from Gaussian are available
to add to the existing distribution.

Although this is a tool that I use in a course, this is also a test bed for
different technologies. As such, the language and frameworks may change
for no reason other that I wanted too.

## Release versions

GitHub actions are used to generate release versions.
A release version can be downloaded from the [Releases](releases) page. The
description will contain the technologies used in that release.

## Building

This application uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). To compile locally, install
the [prerequisites for Tauri](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/),
clone the repository, and install all the JavaScript dependencies in the `ui`
folder.
