# Central Limit Theorem Demonstration

This application illustrates the Central Limit Theorem, specifically how it
tends to a Gaussian distribution when multiple probability distributions are
added. As such, distributions that are far away from Gaussian are available
to add to the existing distribution.

Although this is a tool that I use in a course, this is also a test bed for
different technologies. As such, the language and frameworks may change
for no reason other that I wanted too.
